# BlogByte

## A blog site which supports users and comments

A multi-page website built using `HTML` and `CSS` skills which includes different layouts, and styling. 
Along with the webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper formatting & style. 

Tools used:

- Express
- MongoDB
