# BlogByte

## A simple blog site with CRUD operations which also supports comments.

BlogByte is a multi-page website built using `HTML` and `CSS` and `Javascript` skills which includes different layouts, and styling. 
Along with the webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper formatting & style. 
`node.js` is used on the backend to implement RESTful routing. `Mongoose` is used to store and manage data. Errors are handled on both client and server side.

Tools used:

- Bootstrap
- Express
- MongoDB
